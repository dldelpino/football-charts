# Football Charts

This project aims to collect and display football data related to the top 5 European leagues since the 2000/01 season. It has been developed with [Quasar Framework](quasar.dev) and [Highcharts](highcharts.com) for pie and bar charts. Team badge icons have been taken from [Transfermarkt](transfermarkt.com).

# Football Charts

This project aims to collect and display football data related to the top 5 European leagues since the 2000/01 season. It has been developed with the [Quasar](quasar.dev) framework and the [Highcharts](highcharts.com) library for pie charts and bar charts. Data is stored in CSV files which have been generated by scraping [FBref](fbref.com). Team badge icons have been taken from [Transfermarkt](transfermarkt.com).
